      <p>NFT stands for "non-fungible token." Non-fungible means that each token is unique and irreplaceable. This principle gives NFTs their value and gives rise to a wide range of interesting potential use cases.<br/>
      NFTs can be used for nearly any digital asset or good to ensure authenticity and scarcity. The possibilities are endless, but here are a few example use cases:
      <ul>
      <li><b>In-game assets</b> - NFTs can be used to create unique collectibles in the form of characters, weapons, skins, or other equipment. Players can resell or trade assets directly as they choose, and their authenticity is easily verifiable. No more eBay, no more scammers.</li>
      <li><b>Music and other digital media</b> - NFTs can be used to create rare and unique collectible digital releases. Similarly, NFTs can be used to sell videos, art, or any other type of digital media. Collectors can own digital originals of their favorite songs, movies, or virtually anything else you can imagine.</li>
      <li><b>Digital sports merch</b> - Trading cards, memorabilia, classic moments in sports history, and one-of-a-kind experiences can also be sold as NFTs, opening up a world of possibilities for sports leagues and teams worldwide. The NBA Top Shot website sells collectible “moments” from the league’s history, and at the time of writing, the website is completely sold out and closed for new sign-ups.</li>
      <br/>
      These endpoints wraps up standard NFT implementation and operations, which can be done with them. Endpoints are blockchain agnostic, the only differentatior is the <b>chain</b> parameter in the URL path.<br/><br/>
      Tatum now supports NFT these blockchains:<br/>

        <p>Deploy NFT Smart Contract. This method creates new ERC721 Smart Contract (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the blockchain. Smart contract is standardized and audited.
        It is possible to mint, burn and transfer tokens. It is also possible to mint multiple tokens at once.<br/>

        This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey

        <p>Create one NFT Token and transfer it to destination account. Create and transfer any NFT token from smart contract defined in contractAddress.
        It is possible to add URL to the created token with a more detailed information about it.<br/><br/>
        Tatum now supports NFT these blockchains:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
        <li><b>Polygon (Matic)</b></li>
        <li><b>Kcs (KCS)</b></li>

        <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        For Solana, NFTs are not deployed, only minted right away. Newly created NFT creates new address on the blockchain and owner of the NFT owns with it's private key the account of the NFT.
        <br/>
        This operation works in two modes.

        First mode works just like other NFT endpoints. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey
        or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,
        <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.
        Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.

        Second mode works without private key or signature id.
        Mint NFT requests use built-in smart contract, private key and token id which are provided by Tatum.
        You dont need to provide fromPrivateKey (or signatureId), contractAddress and tokenId fields to perform the mint NFT request.

        Performed request without fromPrivateKey or signatureId fields will be populated with following attributes:

        <ul>
          <li><b>fromPrivateKey</b> - a built-in private key connected to the address from which will be NFT transaction fees paid.</li>
          <li><b>tokenId</b> - a counter which starts from 0 and is increased for each NFT mint request by 1. The tokenId is provided per each chain and mainnet/testnet version of network.</li>
          <li><b>contractAddress</b> - represents Tatum built in smart contract address of the minted NFT.</li>
        </ul>

        The blockchain fee of the performed transaction is paid from the address connected with built-in private key and is debitted in form of credits. The credits are debitted only if NFT mint requests are performed with paid API key plan.
        We transform fee to the credits in accordance to the rates provided by the Tatum.

        It means if you perform mint NFT request with following body:

        <pre>{
          "chain": "CELO",
          "to": "0xBC2eBA680EE50d685cc4Fe65f102AA70AfB27D3F",
          "url": "ipfs://QmXJJ6UF5WkF4WTJvsdhiA1etGwBLfpva7Vr9AudGMe3pj"
        }</pre>

        The fields contractAddress, fromPrivateKey and tokenId will be internally filled in following way:

        <pre>{
          "chain": "CELO",
          "to": "0xBC2eBA680EE50d685cc4Fe65f102AA70AfB27D3F",
          "url": "ipfs://QmXJJ6UF5WkF4WTJvsdhiA1etGwBLfpva7Vr9AudGMe3pj",
          "fromPrivateKey": "{tatumBuiltInPrivateKey}",
          "tokenId": "{tatumBuiltInTokenId + 1}",
          "contractAddress": "0x45871ED5F15203C0ce791eFE5f4B5044833aE10e"
        }</pre>

        Keep in mind that your credit amount will be debitted accordingly to the rate of the selected blockchain and cost of transaction fees.

        Algorand is unique a way that the receiving account should be ready before sending the NFT asset.
        To perform this, the receiving account should transfer the NFT asset with 0 amount to itself.
        During the process, it's using the same API as the main transaction: the only difference is that the "fromPrivateKey" should be the privateKey of the receiving account.
