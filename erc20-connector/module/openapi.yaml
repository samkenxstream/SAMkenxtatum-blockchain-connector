      <p>An ERC-20 token is a standardized Smart Contract with a predefined set of features. It represents fungible tokens, which can be interchanged. The ERC-20 token is used as a blockchain representation of the currency.
      <br/><br/>
      Tatum now supports ERC20 these blockchains:<br/>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
      <li><b>Polygon (Matic)</b></li>
      <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
      <li><b>Celo</b></li>
      <li><b>Harmony.ONE</b></li>
      <li><b>XDC Network (XinFin)</b></li>
      <li><b>Algorand</b></li>

        <p>Deploy ERC20 Smart Contract. This method creates new ERC20 (Fungible Tokens) Smart Contract on the blockchain. Smart contract is standardized and audited. It is possible to mint and burn tokens.
        It is possible to see the code of the deployed contract <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-middleware/blob/master/src/contracts/token.sol" target="_blank">here</a>.
        Whole predefined supply of the tokens will be transferred to the chosen address.
        <br/><br/>
        This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey
        or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,
        <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.
        Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages or Tatum Middleware with a custom key management system is possible.
